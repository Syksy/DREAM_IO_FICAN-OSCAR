# DREAM_2020_IO" 

Workspace of the team FICAN-OSCAR for the DREAM Challenge "Anti-PD1 Response Prediction DREAM Challenge" at https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn18404605/wiki/589611

Key notes:
- Utilized novel R-package OSCAR with L0-pseudo/quasinorm (aka. best subset selection)
- Total 12 training data curated from multiple sources for training IO-predictive signals as well as blocking out prognostic signals in chemo-arms
- One final model constructed that was used for all the subchallenge predictions
- Identified novel gene panel during the challenge with CD274, PDCD1, TIGIT, CXCL9 and CXCR6 depicting TME and ICB responsiveness
- Further genes of interest include CD8A, CCL5, IDO1, and ALK
- Elaborated write-up available at: https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn24180900/wiki/608579
